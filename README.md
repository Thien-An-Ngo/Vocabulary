# Vocabulary
mostly my anki decks

## Setup
- go to [ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and download the Anki-App
- to import the decks, 
  - open your Anki-App and click on the 'Import File' button at the bottom of the window
  - or double click on the .apkg extended files
- the files are downloadable from this repository
- to create a new deck, go to add in the app
- you can manipulate the number of input field needed for your vocabulary set (it makes sense to have three inputs when learning chinese)
- with some basic html and css knowledge, you can change the outlook of your cards to fit your preferences
